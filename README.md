# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U/hub/nft-preview-card-component-634fw4F2d). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

This is the version 2. I implemented a previous solution before learning about keeping my code DRY, CSS variables and using the right units. This is the attempt to improve on the previous areas.

To see version 1 check the branch versions/01.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to keep my CSS DRY and what units to use in order to have an adaptable, scalable and responsive website.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on using the right responsive units and to keep my code DRY.

### Useful resources

- [Improve your CSS by Keepin' it DRY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0px6YH-cauQ&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This helped me understand how to keep my code DRY.
- [Are you using the right CSS units?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5wpD9Ov_To&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand which units to use for what.
- [CSS em and rem explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aDOAMmDHI&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This helped me understand on a deeper level the difference between the **em** and **rem** units.
